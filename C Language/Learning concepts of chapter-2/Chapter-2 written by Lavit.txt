                                    Chapter 2 Instruction and Opreaters

Q-1 what is instructions in c language?
Ans- c program is set of instructions. For ex- if we make any dish in kitchen then we follow the instructions of dish.

In the c program, there are three types of instructions.
(i)  Type declaration Instructions
(ii) Arithmetic Instructions
(iii) Control Instructions

Q-2 Explain the Type Declaration Instructions?
Ans- int a = 3;
     int b = a + 66;
     printf("the value of b is %d \n", b);--- It is correct Type Declaration Instructions

     int b = a + 44;
     int a = 4;
     printf("the value of b is %d \n", b); --- It is wrong Type Declaration Instructions  
                                                Because its gives error by compiler


Q-3  Explain the Arithmetic Instructions?
Ans- In the c language ,there are five types of arithmetic opreaters/instructions.

(i)  + -- is use for addition, unary plus
(ii) - -- is use for subtraction, unary minus
(iii) * -- is use for multipliction
(iv) / -- is use for division
(v) % -- is use for remainder

For Example- int a = 3, b = 4, z;
             int z = a * b; --correct
             int a * b = z; --wrong

Q-4 Explain the Type Conversion?
Ans- An Arithmetic Instruction between
For Example --
int and int -> int
int and float -> float
float and float -> float

5/2 -> 2 , 5.0/2 -> 2.5
2/5 -> 0 , 2.0/5 -> 0.4

Note ->
int a = 3.5; In this case 3.5(float) will be demoted to 3(int) because a is not able to store float.
float a = 5; In this case 5(int) will be demoted to 3.000000(float) because a is not able to store int.

Q-5 Explain the opreator precedence?
Ans- The following table list of opreator priority in c language.
 opreator     priority
   1st         * / %
   2nd          - +
   3rd           =

Q-6 Explain the Opreator Associativity?
Ans- When opreator of equal priority are present is an expression, the fie is taken care of  by associativity.
For Example--
a * b /c --> (a * b) / c 
a / b * c --> (a / b) * c
* / opreators follow left to right associativity

Q-7 Explain the Control instructions in c language?
Ans- Control instructions determine the flow of control in a program.
Four types of control instructions in c language.
(i) Sequence Control Instructions
(ii) Decision Control Instructions
(iii) Loop Control Instructions 
(iv) Case Control Instructions
